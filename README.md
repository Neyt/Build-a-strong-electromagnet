## Why build an electromagnet?
I needed a very strong electromagnet (you cant buy an electromagnet with this kind of strenght online) and this way is realtivaly cheap.


## How?
Old microwaves are compose of 29 pieces:

One of them is the transformer. whithc is compose of two parts. A primary coil, and a secondary coil.

Here is the basics of how Transformers work

If you take the secondary Coil away, and keep the steel core (this directs the electromagenetic force), it will produce and extraordinary electromagnet run with batteries. 
Note if you raise the power it doesnt necesarilly increase the electromagnetic reach or force. It hits an invisible roof.
